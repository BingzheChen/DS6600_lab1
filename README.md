Lab assignment 1 for Bingzhe Chen

## choose a license
I choose the *GNU General Public License v3.0* because it allows other people to use, distribute and modify my code for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. However, this license asks people to distribute any modified versions of the code under the same license, preventing anyone from re-licensing the modified code under a more restrictive or proprietary license.

Had I not supplied a license, the code would be copyrighted by default, meaning others would have very limited rights to use, modify, or distribute it. Without an explicit license, people would generally be unable to legally use the code in their own projects, whether for personal, open-source, or commercial purposes. This could limit collaboration and the code's potential impact.

## examine my .gitignore file
```{python}
