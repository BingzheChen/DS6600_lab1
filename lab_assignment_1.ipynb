    "We can create multiple virtual environments, one for Python 3 and another for Python 4 (in Swedish), allowing us to switch between versions seamlessly as needed for different projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Containers could work but would be overkill, as we don't need full system isolation, just version control for Python.\n",
